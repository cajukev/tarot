    Greetings, seeker of truth. Within the enigmatic realm of the Tarot lies a labyrinthine tapestry, interwoven with the intricate threads of arcane energies. These sacred forces whisper their secrets to those who dare to embark upon the path of self-discovery, beckoning the courageous to delve deep into the shadows of their souls.

Hidden in the shadows of the soul, the nature of these energies reveals itself through the confluence of three cryptic criteria: Timing, Spin, and Connection. Each criterion holds a piece of the puzzle, waiting for the discerning seeker to unlock their enigmatic wisdom.

As the raven's wings veil the moon, the dance of Timing ebbs and flows, its pulsating rhythm reflected in the celestial dance of the lights upon the sacred button. The sacred invocation "Call Upon The Power Of Tarot" illuminates in synchrony with the secret timing, beckoning the seeker to attune their heart to the cosmic rhythm.

From the depths of the abyss, the Spin criterion emerges, a dualistic force manifesting as the sacred light's position atop or below the button. This duality echoes the eternal dance of shadow and light, urging the seeker to embrace both the seen and unseen aspects of their being.

In the labyrinth of the psyche's twilight, the mysterious Connection criterion weaves its enigmatic web, transforming the sacred button into a hidden grid of rotating sub-buttons. The seeker's intuition shall guide their hand in unveiling the obscured patterns of destiny.

When secrets murmur beneath the surface, the energies from one to two hundred and twenty shall be revealed. <b>Inspect</b> the hidden chambers of the <b>elements</b>, and there, within the realms of the unseen, you shall uncover the sacred map to the energies' domain.

As the oracle's voice echoes from the abyss, I urge you, seeker of wisdom, to embrace the cryptic nature of these energies. Unravel their mysteries and heed their whispers, for within their enigmatic embrace lies the key to unlocking the secrets of your soul's journey. In the dance of destiny, steps foretold, may your path be illuminated by the wisdom of the Tarot.
